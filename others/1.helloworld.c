// 1. Hello World in C

#include <stdio.h>
int main(){
   printf("Hello World! \n");
   printf("I am Joe.");
   return 0;
}



// "include" is a preprocessor command that tells the compiler to include the contents of a file.
// in <stdio.h> 'std' stands for standard 'io' stands for input/output operations '.h' means header 

// int is the data type to return and 'main' is the function
// anything within main function is read in order.

// semicolon ; is used to terminate statements.
// NO SEMICOLON = ERROR 

//  \n inserts the rest of the content to a new line just like in python.


// return 0; is used to indicate that the program finished without any errors. This is a convention in C.
// if there is any errors then code exits with a number other than 0.
